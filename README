                             WEBPY-EXAMPLE

This is an example of configuring webpy under Debian / Ubuntu. I wrote it while I was
trying to figure out web.py and stubbed my toe so often that I hoped to help
others out there avoid the problems I had. This app provides examples of the
following things:

  o Templates and form handling
  o Database of user accounts
  o Session management using database backend
  o Authentication using application sessions, HTTP Basic and OAuth
  o REST interface implementation examples with a commandline client
  o User account management

I do my development on Debian Squeeze and Unstable, but I am fairly confident
that recent (Spring 2011) Ubuntu releases should work as well. To install
this in a semi-automated way, run these commands or ones like them from the
root of the source tree:

  $ sudo dpkg -i dependencies/*.deb
  $ sudo apt-get -f install
  $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -tc -b
  $ sudo dpkg -i ../*.deb
  $ sudo apt-get -f install

At this point, if I haven't messed something up, you should be able to go to:

  http://localhost/webpy-example/

...and drive the app around. Here is some other general information

  o The app is built to run with Apache 2.2 and Postgresql (8.4 or 9.0)
  o The administrative account is 'admin' and the password is 'admin'
  o You can get all the logs from the scripts by running:
      sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/error.log
  o It is easier to just chown /usr/share/webpy-example and play around
    in there, rather than building a package to test changes. Don't
    forget to reload Apache when you make code changes!
      sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
  o You can also update /etc/apache2/conf.d/webpy-example to point to your
    checked out directory, but you have to copy over the credentials.py from
    the installed directory.
  o The database schema is in pgsql.sql and will be created automatically
    via dbconfig-common automation. One issue is that if you re-install the
    package, you should purge (dpkg --purge webpy-example) first and when
    reinstalling select to use the package maintainers version of the
    configuration file when prompted.

If you need help, my first suggestion is to stick with it and read the code,
use the web.py docs (http://webpy.org/docs/0.3/api) and if you still can't
figure it out, try the issue reports / message boards / mailing lists for
web.py and other associated code:

  o Web.py: http://groups.google.com/group/webpy/
  o OAuth: https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2
  o passlib: http://packages.python.org/passlib/
  o mimerender: http://code.google.com/p/mimerender/

I am usually pretty busy, but I can sometimes answer questions if you are
prepared to wait until I find some spare time.
